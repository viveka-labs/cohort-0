# PR Fix

## Purpose

Fix issues identified in PR reviews, addressing both blocking and minor concerns systematically.

## When to Use

- After receiving PR review feedback
- When PR has requested changes
- To address review comments before merge

## Task-Specific Rules

Before fixing, check for relevant rule files in `.claude/rules/` that apply to the changed files. Load and follow all applicable rules.

**Always load:** [workflow.md](../../rules/workflow.md)

## Fix Process

### Phase 1: Gather Review Context

1. **Fetch PR details:**

   ```bash
   gh pr view {pr_number} --json number,title,body,headRefName,baseRefName,author,url
   ```

2. **Get review comments:**

   ```bash
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/reviews
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments
   ```

3. **Get changed files:**
   ```bash
   gh pr diff {pr_number}
   ```

### Phase 2: Categorize Issues

1. **Extract all issues from reviews:**
   - Inline comments (file:line specific)
   - General review comments
   - Review verdicts and reasons

2. **Categorize by severity:**

   | Category    | Indicator                                       | Priority   |
   | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
   | Blocking ❌ | "must", "required", "blocking", REQUEST_CHANGES | Fix first  |
   | Minor ⚠️    | "consider", "suggestion", "nit", COMMENT        | Fix second |

3. **Create fix plan with TodoWrite:**

   ```
   - [ ] Fix: {blocking issue 1}
   - [ ] Fix: {blocking issue 2}
   - [ ] Fix: {minor issue 1}
   - [ ] Verify all fixes
   ```

4. **WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding**

### Phase 3: Load Context

1. **Read each affected file** (full content, not just diff)

2. **Load relevant rules** based on file paths

3. **Understand the original intent** from PR description

### Phase 4: Fix Issues

1. **Work through todos one at a time:**
   - Mark todo as `in_progress` before starting
   - Mark as `completed` immediately after finishing

2. **For each fix:**
   - Read the specific comment/issue
   - Understand what's being asked
   - Make the change following loaded rules
   - Summarize what was changed

3. **After each fix:**
   - Provide summary with code snippets
   - Include file:line references
   - WAIT for user confirmation

### Phase 5: Verify Fixes

1. **Run checks:**

   ```bash
   yarn typecheck
   yarn lint
   yarn test
   ```

2. **Review against original comments:**
   - Does each fix address the feedback?
   - Any unintended side effects?

3. **Fix any new issues introduced**

## Output Format

After all fixes are complete:

```markdown
## ✅ PR Fixes Complete

## Principles to Follow

1. **Address the actual feedback** — Don't assume, read carefully
2. **Follow loaded rules** — Rules files are source of truth
3. **One fix at a time** — Don't batch changes, fix incrementally
4. **Verify each fix** — Ensure it actually addresses the comment
5. **Don't over-fix** — Only change what was requested
