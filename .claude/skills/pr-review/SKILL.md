# PR Review

## Purpose

Review pull requests to ensure code quality, architectural soundness, and adherence to project conventions.

## When to Use

- Reviewing any pull request
- Evaluating code changes before merge
- Checking adherence to project standards

## Review Process

1. **Understand the context**
   - Read PR description and linked tickets
   - Understand what problem is being solved
   - Check the scope of changes

2. **Research third-party dependencies (MANDATORY)**
   - Identify ALL third-party libraries and dependencies in the changed code
   - Use WebSearch to find latest documentation, best practices, and common mistakes
   - Verify the code uses these dependencies correctly and as intended
   - Check for version-specific behavior or configuration options
   - See "External Technology Research" section below for details

3. **Analyze the changes**
   - Review each changed file thoroughly
   - Don't just skim the diff—understand what each function/module does
   - Consider how changes fit into the existing system
   - Compare implementation against researched best practices

4. **Apply your lens**
   - Use your agent's focus areas (architecture vs implementation)
   - Check against your agent's checklist items
   - Apply the Challenge & Propose format for issues

5. **Document findings**
   - Use the output format below
   - Be specific with file:line references
   - Distinguish blocking vs minor issues
   - Include findings from external research

## External Technology Research

**This phase is MANDATORY for any PR that uses third-party dependencies or external technologies.**

### When to Research

Any code using something you didn't write:

- Third-party libraries and frameworks
- Platform or browser APIs
- External services and integrations
- Build tools and configuration
- Any dependency where correct usage matters

### What to Search For

1. **Correct usage** — Is the API being used as intended?
2. **Configuration options** — Are there settings that should be customized?
3. **Common mistakes** — What do people typically get wrong?
4. **Version-specific behavior** — Check `package.json` versions against docs
5. **Performance considerations** — Any known gotchas?

### How to Research

```
"{library/technology} best practices {current year}"
"{library/technology} {version} documentation"
"{library/technology} common mistakes"
"{library/technology} correct usage"
"{library/technology} vs {alternative}"
```

### Research Output

Include a research summary in your review:

```markdown
### 🔍 External Technology Research

| Technology | Findings                | Impact on PR     |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| {name}     | {key finding from docs} | {recommendation} |
```

## Common Checklist

These items apply regardless of review perspective:

- [ ] No exposed secrets or API keys
- [ ] No console.log or debugging code left in
- [ ] No commented-out code without explanation
- [ ] Imports organized and minimal
- [ ] Follows existing patterns in codebase
- [ ] Changes are within scope of PR description
- [ ] Third-party dependencies used correctly (verified via research)
- [ ] No common mistakes for libraries/technologies used

## Output Format

```markdown
## {Agent Name} Review — Verdict: {VERDICT}

### Issues

| #   | Severity    | File         | Issue                 | Suggestion                   |
| --- | ----------- | ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1   | ❌ Blocking | `file.ts:42` | {concise description} | {only if fix is non-obvious} |
| 2   | ⚠️ Minor    | `file.ts:15` | {concise description} | {only if fix is non-obvious} |

### Architectural Concerns

{Only include this section for genuine design-level issues where the fix isn't obvious.
Use: **{Concern title}** (`file.ts:line`) — 1–2 sentences max. Omit section entirely if none.}

### Research Flags

{Only include if third-party dependency research found misuse. Omit section entirely if none.}

| Technology | Issue          | Recommendation |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| {name}     | {what's wrong} | {what to do}   |
```

**Rules:**

- Omit `Architectural Concerns` section entirely if there are none
- Omit `Research Flags` section entirely if there are none
- Omit `Issues` table entirely if there are no issues (verdict will be `APPROVED`)
- `Suggestion` column: only populate when the fix isn't obvious from the description
- No "Observations", "What's done well", or praise of any kind
- No summary status table
- Challenge & Propose format is retired — use `Architectural Concerns` for design discussions only

## Posting the Review

When posting via `gh api`, use **both** the body and inline comments:

### Review Body (`body` parameter)

Use the output format above for the overall review summary.

### Inline Comments (`comments` parameter)

Add inline comments for each blocking and minor issue at its exact location:

```json
{
  "comments": [
    {
      "path": "src/components/button.tsx",
      "line": 42,
      "body": "**Issue:** Missing error handling for null case.\n\n**Suggestion:** Add a null check before accessing properties."
    },
    {
      "path": "src/utils/format.ts",
      "line": 15,
      "body": "**Minor:** Consider using `const` instead of `let` here since the value is never reassigned."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Finding Line Numbers

To get the correct `line` number for inline comments:

1. **From the diff:** Use `gh pr diff {pr_number}` to get file patches
2. **Line numbers:** Use the line number in the **new file** (right side of diff), not the diff position
3. **Only comment on changed lines:** Inline comments must be on lines that appear in the diff

### Review Event

| Condition         | Event             |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| No issues found   | `APPROVE`         |
| Minor issues only | `COMMENT`         |
| Blocking issues   | `REQUEST_CHANGES` |

### Example API Call

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/reviews \
  --method POST \
  --input - <<'EOF'
{
  "body": "{review summary using output format above}",
  "event": "COMMENT",
  "comments": [
    {"path": "file.tsx", "line": 42, "body": "Issue description..."}
  ]
}
EOF
```

## Verdict Options

| Agent                   | Verdicts                                           | When to Use         |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Principal Architect** | `APPROVED`, `NEEDS DISCUSSION`, `CHANGES REQUIRED` | Architecture review |
| **SDE2**                | `APPROVED`, `MINOR CHANGES`, `CHANGES REQUIRED`    | Code quality review |

### Verdict Guidelines

| Condition                                          | Verdict                               |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| No issues found                                    | `APPROVED`                            |
| Only minor style/preference issues                 | `MINOR CHANGES` or `NEEDS DISCUSSION` |
| Bugs, missing error handling, architectural issues | `CHANGES REQUIRED`                    |

## Agent-Specific Focus

Each agent applies their own lens when using this skill:

### Principal Architect Focus

- System design and patterns
- Scalability implications
- Data model correctness
- API contract clarity
- Security boundaries
- Extensibility

### SDE2 Focus

- Type safety
- Error handling
- Code structure and readability
- Naming conventions
- Edge cases
- Testability

See agent files for detailed focus areas and checklists.
